# Network Security Monitoring Lab
In this lab, I demonstrated mastery of IDS detection and network traffic analysis to identify, analyze, and investigate potential indicators of compromise 
and evidence of malicious activity through analysis, correlation, and confirmation of IDS alert events.

## Lab Objectives:
- Understand Snort syntax and rule structure
- Understand Zeek syntax
- Understand the structure of an alert message
- Construct Snort rules to find anomalous or interesting traffic
- Use Snort to process packet capture and generate alerts
- Perform analysis of alert messages
- Perform correlation with Snort and Zeek

## Skills Learned
- IDS rule creation
- IDS alerts analysis
- Log analysis
- Network artifact correlation
- Discover indicators of compromise
- Discover evidence of enumeration, compromise, and data exfiltration
- Perform datastream reassembly

## Tools Used
- Snort
- Zeek
- Tshark

## Steps
This lab was completed as part of the SANS Institute course SEC401: Security Essentials - Network, Endpoint, and Cloud. I HIGHLY recommend this course!
